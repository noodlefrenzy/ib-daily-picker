# Request to LLM Coding Agent

We need your assistance in clearly outlining the current coding challenge we're encountering. We have access to a deep research agent that can provide comprehensive insights, but we first need you to craft a detailed prompt based on our existing problems. The goal is to leverage this prompt to gather the best practices, recommended approaches, and idiomatic solutions specific to our issue.

## Crafting the Research Prompt

Please create a structured prompt with the following sections:

### 1. Clear Problem Definition

* Precisely define the issue we are facing.
* Include relevant error messages, stack traces, or problematic behaviors.

### 2. Contextual Information

* Specify the technology stack involved (languages, frameworks, libraries).
* Include exact versions of key dependencies and any recent updates.
* Mention any recent codebase changes potentially related to the problem.

### 3. Key Research Questions

* Identify clear, actionable research questions to guide the deep research agent.
* Ensure these questions target resolving our current challenge directly.

### 4. Recommended Tools and Resources

* List specific tools, libraries, or methodologies we should investigate.
* Include any helpful links or references.

### 5. Practical Examples

* Request practical code examples demonstrating the recommended solutions.

### 6. Pitfalls and Mitigation

* Ask for common mistakes related to the identified issue and best practices to avoid them.

### 7. Integration Considerations

* Include any special considerations or potential impacts on our existing workflows and CI/CD pipelines.

Please ensure the prompt is detailed, clear, and actionable, facilitating precise and valuable insights from our deep research agent.
